# QRStudentAttendanceApp
A Student attendance application using QR Code.
The project involves students signing in and out for classes they attend through scanning lecturer's QR Code. The data will be viewed by
both the lecturer and the student (read only) but managed by the lecturer (read and write) who is the superuser thus providing the right privileges to authorized users.
