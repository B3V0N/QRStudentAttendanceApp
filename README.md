# QRStudentAttendanceApp
A Student attendance application using QR Code.
The project involves students signing in and out of classes they attend through scanning lecturer's QR Code. The data will be viewed by both the lecturer and the student (read only) but managed by the lecturer (read and write) who is the superuser thus providing the right privileges to authorized users. This will change the normal signing for class using the class attendance sheet with a QR code system enabling mutual understanding and agreement between the lecturer and the student in terms and conditions for any class attendance.
